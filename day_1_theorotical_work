>try to generate entities and parameters for different actors.
>Make planning for next day workflow.

Actors:

Students: The primary users of the Techinspire Academy platform who will access and utilize the various educational resources and courses offered by the platform.
Instructors: The individuals responsible for creating and managing the courses offered on the platform, as well as providing support to students.
Administrators: The individuals responsible for managing the overall operation and functionality of the Techinspire Academy platform.

Use cases:

Register for an account: Students and instructors will be able to register for an account on the Techinspire Academy platform in order to access the various features and resources.
Browse available courses: Students will be able to search and browse through the available courses on the platform to find courses that meet their educational needs.
Enroll in courses: Once students have found a course they would like to take, they can enroll in the course and gain access to the course materials and resources.
Complete courses: Students will be able to progress through the course materials and complete assignments and assessments to earn a certificate of completion.
Create and manage courses: Instructors will be able to create and manage the courses offered on the platform, including uploading course materials and setting assignments and assessments.
Manage student progress: Instructors will be able to monitor and manage the progress of their students, including viewing grades and providing feedback.
Manage platform functionality: Administrators will be responsible for managing the overall functionality of the Techinspire Academy platform, including monitoring server performance and
ensuring that the platform is secure and up-to-date.

Scope:

The scope of the Techinspire Academy project includes the development of a web-based educational platform that allows students to browse and enroll in courses, complete course materials
and assignments and earn certificates of completion. Instructors will be able to create and manage courses on the platform and monitor student progress, while administrators will be 
responsible for ensuring the overall functionality and security of the platform. The project will be developed using Java and will utilize various web development technologies, such as
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as a backend database system to store course materials and student progress. The platform will initially offer a limited number of courses in a specific
field, with the potential for expansion and growth over time.

The Techinspire Academy project is a software platform designed for online learning. The platform provides courses on various topics and allows students to enroll and access course
materials. Instructors are responsible for creating and managing the courses, and students can track their progress and receive feedback on their performance.

The system architecture of Techinspire Academy may involve the following components:

A database to store all the data related to the courses, students, and instructors, as well as their relationships and progress tracking information.

An application layer that includes the various modules and functionalities required for the platform, such as user registration and login, course enrollment, course material access, and
progress tracking.

A presentation layer that provides the user interface for the platform, including the web pages and graphics.

The following entities can be defined to store the required data in the database:

Students Entity:
student_id (primary key)
first_name
last_name
email
phone_number
enrollment_status

Instructors Entity:
instructor_id (primary key)
first_name
last_name
email
course_id (foreign key)

Courses Entity:
course_id (primary key)
course_name
course_description
prerequisites

Course Materials Entity:
material_id (primary key)
material_name
material_type
course_id (foreign key)

Progress Tracking Entity:
progress_id (primary key)
student_id (foreign key)
course_id (foreign key)
grade
completion_status
time_spent

These entities represent the basic information needed to track and manage the courses, students, instructors, and progress on the Techinspire Academy platform.

The application layer can be built using a programming language such as Java, with a web framework such as Spring Boot for efficient development. The presentation layer can be designed
using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The database can be implemented using a database management system such as MySQL.
